# SkyChart-360-Panorama
This script takes a sky chart and a 360° panorama of an horizon and merges the sky chart to the horizon. This allows to view the sky chart in the context of your panorama. Through a 360° image viewer, or by importing the image in Stellarium, you can then take a look at your sky chart with your phone with AR/VR.
